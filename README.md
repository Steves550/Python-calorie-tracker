# Python-calorie-tracker
This program is created to track how many calories a person will burn if they went running based on 100 calories per mile. First, it asks the user how many calories they have consumed for the day followed by the number of miles run. It will then return how many calories were burned based on how many miles ran and then subtract the burned calories from the total amount entered for the day. In the end, it will ask the user how many miles they expect to run tomorrow. The message that will display after this input will be different if miles for tomorrow are more than, less than, or equal to the miles run today.
